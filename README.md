# The Monkees Band Website

As my first milestrone project, I decided to take on the suggested idea of creating a static website for the famous musicians and TV start, The Monkees. 

The Monkees were a playful, lively group and I wanted this to come through in this site in the images and colours used.
The hero image used throughout the site shows the band memebers performing and captures each members characteristics.


The aim for this site is for the user to be able to easily move arounnd each page and explore its simple but informative layout. 
A user can go navigate their way easily around the website and find upcoming tour information, the band's latest news and also be 
able to learn how they evolved as a band. I aimed to included a vaired selection of images and video clips to ensure the site is visually 
interesting and that the user is continiously reminded of The Monkees image.  


## UX

This is a static website with information about the band members nad their upcoming tour dates. A user can learn about the band's recent news and their history. 
There is also the option for a user to send an enquiry to the band and to sign up to their newsletter. The site can be viewed here **Github Link**.

The colours used throughout the site are warm, bright and complimenting, allowing text to be easy to read and any media to stand out on the page. The site is styled with
Bootstrap and utiliazes different Bootstrap components. There is a responsive navigation bar which allows the user to explore the site easily. Other components include a hero image which is consitent throughout 
the website, a timeline with media of the band to provide a visual way to learn about their past 
and an image carousel. All features are responsive and can be viewed on mobile, tablet and desktop.
